            <p>Chapter One</p>
<p>PRESENT
Raven</p>
<p>I’m lying down on my front, my brow is stuck to the cold surface of the floor, and I press my shaking hands to my head. The crackle of the programmed weapon hits horrendously against my eardrum, and the sharp pieces of crushed glass are scattered all over the shop. My intuitive says, Get up and run! However, I don’t tune in to it. Instep, I accumulate all my mettle, draw my head up between my shoulders, and cautiously creep towards the cellar steps. I know in case I let freeze completely take control rather than acting sensibly, it might taken a toll my life. Back when we were youthful, my father and my uncle arranged my cousins and me for what we are to do in a circumstance like this in the event that we need to live. Keep to the floor, get out of the line of fire, explore for shelter, hold up for fortification. How I trusted I would never need to review these enlightening, but the gunfire hitting against the divider of my party benefit shop brutally yanks me back onto the ground of reality.A few individuals are looking for to hurt me once more, there's seething chaos all around me, and I can’t do anything almost it. “Sue! Jason! On the floor. Get down!” I yell at the best of my lungs. Behind my back, the tremendous, agent bottle of chardonnay – a blessing from my uncle when I opened this shop full of trust, two a long time back – detonates with a colossal impact. I weakly observe as the glass cabinet stuffed with delights falls to a horde pieces with a stunning crash, but I don’t turn back. Decided, I creep on forward towards the cellar steps, overcoming the part torment caused by the pieces of glass puncturing my lower arms. I don’t need to pass on. I don’t proposed to be the another casualty of this thoughtless war which has as of now taken a toll as well much blood. Indeed my parents’ – the agonizing thought flashes through my brain as I reach the cellar entryway. I can’t indeed bear to think how numerous have yielded their lives on the holy place of family dependability: relatives, companions, or those who were in a few way or another connected to the Bertone clan. The frantic cry of Sue, my confectioner can indeed be listened through the clamor of the gunfire. “Stay down. This way. This way!” I mouth to them, and passionately point to the cellar steps. Seeing the pale faces of my two representatives shuddering on the floor, my heart sinks and the acknowledgment hits me difficult like a sharp poet: this chapter of my life has come to an conclusion. Indeed in case we survive the gunfire, nothing will stay the same. I will need to escape once once more, clearing out behind all that I’ve overseen to construct up so distant. I can’t indeed say how frequently I’ve had to fear for my life.
With my back against the divider, I sit hunkered on the tiles of the cellar. Adjacent to me, Jason gazes before himself with a pale confront, in stun. Sue, our something else amusing and cheerful confectioner sits on the as it were chair accessible, snatching its edge with both hands, her entire body shaking. I calmed them as before long as I bolted the entryway behind us, and presently we all hold up in an awe-struck quiet, to see what will happen. The clamor of gunfire upstairs kicked the bucket a whereas back, and we not listen strides either, but I still won’t open the entryway. It can be fair a trap as they hold up for us to slither back out of our covering up put. It’s much more secure on the off chance that we hold up for Uncle Emilio’s individuals. Since they will come, I’m dead certain around it. Depleted, I near my eyes, and incline my head against the divider with a murmur. I’m unspeakably tired of the complete matter. Two a long time of hard work has fair come to nothing, within the course of a number of minutes, however, it’s not the funds I’m stressed approximately. Cash has never been an issue within the Bertone family. My Uncle Emilio would sponsor the rebuilding of the shop, or he’d essentially purchase me another one. Of course, I would never let him do that, and after that he would sulk for a whereas approximately my unyielding quality. It filled me with perpetual delight that I built my party benefit shop with my own reserves, without his budgetary back. Emilio Bertone likes to accept that he can illuminate any issue with cash, and he can closed each mouth with many fresh bank notes.</p>
<p>What stresses me much more is what the noteworthiness of this attack may be. It was an open decree of war on Uncle Emilio, who, by the see of it, is once once more at war with one of the equal mafia families, or perhaps with indeed more. The outfitted assault was a caution that his foes are not frightened of anything, and they are prepared to go all the way, indeed to harm his family. The shock does not as it were result within the devastation of my shop, but moreover that I need to grant up on the existence I have worked so difficult to construct up. What’s more, the peace of intellect that I have battled so much for, is additionally demolished altogether. With a quiet gaze, I ponder my employees’ faces frightened to passing. Representatives, who have ended up my companions within the past two a long time, but with whom presently I need to break contact. I know my uncle will liberally pay attention of them for their quiet in return, and they will likely have nothing to stress approximately monetarily until they discover modern work – but typically as it were one viewpoint of the issue. I’m on the edge of crying at the thought we might never meet once more, and I can as it were trust in time they will oversee to urge over the otherworldly side of the injury as well.
My family is to be faulted for everything. All the severity I’ve had to go through within the past ten a long time was brought around by the Bertones’ black market exercises. Gracious, how numerous times I wished I had been born into a ordinary family! Within the middle of individuals who may not have so much cash, but what they do have, does not come from illicit exchange or car commerce, the operation of clubs, drugs and weapon-smuggling. To be born into a family where there's no require for a bodyguard to visit the musical drama house. Where cars are not pulled off the street by hoodlums, and guardians don't leave their thirteen-year-old girl an vagrant, or, dreading the exact retribution of rivals, uncles don't keep their niece beneath bolt and key in an domain that seem pass for a bunker.
Crying my heart out after a basic occasion like this, I continuously reach the point where my adored cousins, Alessandro and Christiano come to my intellect, who do adore me. Sandro is four a long time my senior, Chris is one year more seasoned than me, and they are in fact like brothers to me. As a matter of reality, they do treat me like their small sister, with all positive and negative viewpoints considered. And of course, I keep in mind my cool Close relative Claire, once my mum’s confidante, who has filled the part of a moment mother in my life
since the passing of my genuine mum. And there’s moreover my Uncle Emilio Bertone, the Boss. A devoted and caring father, adoring spouse, fruitful businessman, and something else the foremost powerful mafia wear of the East Coast. Uncle Emilio doesn’t have a girl, so he venerates me, ruins and ensures me as in case I was his claim. And I, no matter how difficult I attempt to despise the mafia boss, can never hold hard feelings against him as well long. I don’t call him my father, but I do consider him that in my heart. And, of course, there’s my boyfriend Johnny, whom I met through a party benefit work half a year back, and I feel committed to him since he has nothing to do with the mafia world. We go out together, have a part of fun, and in time this might turn into something genuine. My romance with Johnny isn't precisely just like the ejection of a well of lava, there’s no overpowering energy included, but it has potential. And, I know it from sharp involvement that not indeed overpowering energy ensures things will turn out great between a man and a woman. These individuals are my family. So, by the time I reach this point in my bleak thoughts, I continuously realize that I’d never alter them for anything else, and I’d miss them appallingly on the off chance that they vanished from my life. I don’t require any more excruciating farewells, and I not need to cry over the coffin of a cherished one. I despise the family’s black market exercises, but I do adore the family itself. In soul, I’m incapable to isolated the bloody-handed mafia boss from Uncle Emilio, who utilized to engage us beneath the Christmas tree playing his violin, tricking around. I’m fully aware how schizophrenic the full circumstance is, but usually the Bertone clan, and I, whether I need it or not, am a portion of this entirety madness.
The sound of strides hits my ear, which at once drags me out of my tormenting contemplations. The clamor comes from closer and closer, at that point there's a quieted thump from the other side of the thick concrete entryway. Startled, we see at each other, and I’m beyond any doubt Sue is as it were a hair’s breath from swooning. I discreetly put a finger to my mouth, and getting up on my knees, I creep to Sue’s chair, who gazes with eyes open wide and holds her breath as I reach beneath her chair and drag at something. The metal body of the gun respectfully slides into my palm as I draw back my hand. I stand up and lift my finger warningly, once once more to quiet the other two. With the 9mm Infant Glock in my hand, I tiptoe to the door. Meanwhile , a memory comes to my intellect – it was at the opening of the shop that Uncle Emilio</p>
<p>called my consideration to this special “gift” which he at that point planted within the cellar. For extraordinary events, he said, putting accentuation on the words, but at the time I didn’t need to attribute any importance to the motion. I trusted I would never require it, and I overlooked around the total thing. Until presently. There may never be a more extraordinary event – the bitter thought crosses my intellect as I stop before the entryway and attempt to listen. “Raven? Are you in there? It’s me, Enrico.” A immense moan breaks from my chest as I recognize the voice of Enrico, my uncle’s most steadfast man. This implies we are spared. For presently, at slightest. Emilio Bertone has sent Enrico in individual for me, which tells me that I’m more profound in shit than I have thought. The 6.4 tall, bare muscle man is as it were many a long time more youthful than my uncle, but he is considered one of the most seasoned hands within the family. He is the so-called consigliere. Emilio Bertone’s right hand, trustee, advisor and the one who oversees his most sensitive affairs.
“We’re here, Enrico,” I reply with a few alleviation. “Who’s in there with you?” he hollers from the other side. “It’s fair Sue and Jason. Fair us three in here.” “Okay, young lady. The coast is obvious out here. You'll be able open the door.” I put the gun down the belt on my pants, take a profound breath and embed the key into the lock. “Are you beyond any doubt? What… what if…” I listen the stressed address behind my back. I turn around. Jason is looking at me with understudies open wide and a pale white confront. That’s when it day breaks on me that my workers know nothing around Enrico, the mafia and the complicated points of interest of my family foundation.</p>
<p>I have never uncovered the entire truth to them, it would have made no sense. When it comes to private issues, I show the same schedule adaptation since I was thirteen: my guardians kicked the bucket in a appalling car mishap and I was raised by my uncle and close relative, who are business people. To my colleagues I’m fair a twenty- six-year-old youthful lady who runs a party benefit, and who needs to assist children with discourse absconds after gaining her degree in uncommon instruction and discourse treatment. In their intrigued, it’s best if I let them go on considering so. Our shared work, within the light of today’s occasions, is presently history – I think with resignation. “All great, Jas. We’re secure now.”</p>
<p>After Enrico makes beyond any doubt that I don’t have a bullet wound, he gives me a caring grasp, and depends Sue and Jason to his men’s care. I have no question that he’ll attempt to take off the scene some time recently the police arrive, so I don’t have a chance to trade indeed fair some words with my colleagues in peace. Speedily, Enrico pushes me towards the protected Mercedes with the tinted windows, stopped at the back exit of the shop. Hardly do we sit into it, able to as of now listen the sirens of the drawing nearer police cars. Enrico gives the order to the driver, and the car clears out behind the side road with shrieking tires, to create its way to the Bertone domain.</p>
<p>I can clearly see the help on Enrico’s confront at my getting absent with the assault lively. In case Emilio is like a father to me, at that point it’s reasonable to say that I see Enrico as an uncle. He has known me since my birth, knew my guardians, his spouse weaved dresses for me when I was a kid, and a long time back I played with his children within the cultivate of the family home. Enrico isn't a man of words, he keeps calm indeed presently, but his tense expression gives absent the seethe interior him. It’s for a reason that his moniker is “Fist” within the black market circles.</p>
<p>He angles the primary help pack out of the compartment beneath the situate, pours some disinfectant on a chunk of cotton, and with his thick fingers, he clumsily starts to clean the wounds on my lower arm. I gratefully put my hand on his, but select to require the cotton and proceed the cleaning myself. “Have you talked to the Boss? I know he attempted to urge a hold of you yesterday,” Enrico asks after a whereas, with a voice full of dejection. “No,” I murmur. “We haven’t talked, but I was attending to call him back after we’ve conveyed the Chandler engagement order.” I feel sick as I think approximately Chandler and all the other baffled clients whose orders presently I have to be cancel and whom I ought to advise that they ought to discover another party benefit, since Conveyed Delights has ceased to exist. It’s been shot to bits. Smashed to pieces, similar to Raven Bertone’s bona fide plans for the future. I agonizingly look to the side.</p>
<p>“Did my uncle suspect anything? Is that why he needed to talk to me?” Enrico worriedly scratches his forehead. “I’m perplexed, he did. He needed to caution you to take care, but none of us anticipated things to urge that harsh so before long. We’ve fucked up huge time,” the words break from his mouth with outrage, at that point he sends me an apologetic look at once, as in case I was still an blameless small young lady. “We’ve let those mongrels strike on us,” he punches the front seat’s back. It looks like he sees these occasions as his claim individual disappointment, so I delicately press his gigantic, chapped hand. It’s futile for him to fault himself. He looks to the side and talks once more, with a self-contradicting grin on his face. “You did truly great, young lady. Your fast response spared all of your lives. I’m pleased of you.”
I grunt with despondency. What do I say to that? Hone makes idealize, I think sharply. As I lay back within the comfortable calfskin situate, the 9mm is squeezed against me. I reach behind me and drag the Child Glock out of my belt. Enrico takes it at once. “I by one means or another felt that this infant would once once more be needed,” he includes with a wry smile. I don’t comment on this. Instep, I near my eyes tiredly. After the assault, it’s clearly out of the address that we go to my put. I know the method all as well well. They take me to my uncle’s house that's secured like a post, and his individuals will get my individual stuff from my house, and bring it all here for me. Breathing profoundly, I attempt to calm myself and get ready in soul for all that is standing by, but dissatisfaction shapes a protuberance in my throat. Sentiments of disillusionment and outrage are relentlessly filling my entire body.</p>
